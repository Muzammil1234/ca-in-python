Copmutation Argumentation in Python
===================================


Description
===========

Argumentation is an integral part of both professional and everyday communication. 
Whenever a topic or question is subject to controversy, people consider arguments to form opinions, 
to make decisions, or to convince others of a certain stance. In the last years, the computational 
analysis and synthesis of natural language argumentation has become an emerging research area, due
to its importance for the next generation of web search engines and intelligent personal assistance.
Based on fundamental techniques from natural language processing, computational argumentation ranges
from the mining of arguments from natural language text, over the assessment of argumentation 
quality, to the retrieval of arguments in web search.
